## About
This web app will allow users to track the Air Quality Index (AQI) for every city. By typing in the name of the city and pressing "Check Air Quality" button it will display the air quality value for the selected city. 
OpenAQ's API service was used to collect the data used for this Web App, as they offer an open, real time database of air quality data that is aggregated from public data sources such as government and research institutes. 

This app was designed using continuous deployment and development strategies to aid with productivity and product quality. 

Continuous Integration (CI): The practice of merging code changes into a single central repository once the code has been tested for errors. This allows developers to detect issues early to aid in debugging.

Continuous Deployment (CD): The practice of automatically deploying code to production once the tests have been performed. Which allows for updates to be implemented quickly and ensures that the software is always available for deployment.

## Project Management
To manage the requirements of my project effectively, I used the project tracking functionality in GitHub Project. This allowed me to create issues in line with the requirements for the project, and set timescales for each of these issues. 
GitHub projects provides an easy-to-use interface to implement Agile methodologies into my project, where the tracking and assigning tasks will be used until completion. 

To begin, I created a Kanban board with the intial requirements for the project, to visualize tasks that were in progress, and manage the flow of each task to completion.
